This week, Jordan and Joshua speak with two linguists to discuss how internet culture and even the act of texting has completely morphed the way the world communicates with each other. First, linguist David Crystal discusses how language has always evolved and changed, but the rapid-fire evolution of communication technology has thrown that change into hyperdrive. Plus, linguist Gretchen McCulloch explains more specifically how internet lingo has created a new form of language, merging written and spoken language, which is creating a generational gap, even between people born within a few years of each other. Whether you like it or not, the way you speak has been influenced by the technology around us. The question is, is this just a natural progression that has happened since the beginning of spoken language, or a sign of the decay of our society?",

In East London, Bikeworks run cycling for wellbeing sessions for women returning to their bikes, after a long break. Melanie goes out with a group who've been cycling together now for a few weeks. Cycling is still, predominantly a male, middle class sport. Getting more women involved isn't easy, especially for women of colour.

        description: "In this episode, we‚Äôre displaying the most impressive artists of the animal kingdom. From tiny visual masterpieces, to animals that can dance to a beat, we‚Äôre shining a spotlight on the art that can be found in nature. Deep in the Amazon rainforest, there‚Äôs a tiny structure that (if you‚Äôre able to spot it) catches your eye. The intricate silk henge is a mini masterpiece, and for some time nobody could say exactly what it was or why it existed. Phil Torres takes us on his journey of discovery and demystification. Next we‚Äôre exploring whether animals can dance to a beat and, if so, why? To help us try and answer that, we hear from Henkjan Honing, professor of Music Cognition at the University of Amsterdam. Finally, we turn our attention to Northern Australia‚Äôs great bowerbird. What can the males' elaborate constructions teach us about perspective?",

        description: 'We take a trip into the past to discuss the history of vaccines. We start with an overview of smallpox, a debilitating illness that has plagued humans for thousands of years, and how attempts to prevent smallpox resulted in the first rudimentary immunizations through the process of variolation. Over time, variolation evolved to the first instances of vaccinations, and we detail Edward Jenner‚Äôs famous accounts of using cowpox to immunize individuals against smallpox. From there, we discuss the rapid emergence of scientific advances regarding infectious diseases and vaccine technologies, tracking Pasteur‚Äôs and Koch‚Äôs work on Germ Theory of Disease and the development of rabies vaccinations. We summarize the progression and evolution of vaccines through the 19th and 20th centuries, highlighting some key examples.',
